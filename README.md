# Young's Notes
This repo is just a collection of notes I've written throughout my coursework at Penn. I made it public in the hopes that it'll be useful for future students someday.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository onto your computer __or__ download individual files/folders that you need online. I recommend simply reading the files online so that the Markdown renders nicely on your web browser.
2. Feel free to make a pull request if you want to contribute to the notes.
3. Happy studying!
